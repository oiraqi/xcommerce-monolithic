# XCommerce Monolithic - Spring
This is the core module of the enterprise-class XCommerce application based on a monolithic-mvc-soa architecture. It is written in Java and leverages Spring Boot as a highly productive, opinionated enterprise application development and production environment. Spring Boot orchestrates several technologies powering XCommerce Monolithic, namely JPA (on top of Hibernare and MySQL), Redis and REST.
